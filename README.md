The results of [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%201:%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20brain%20atrophy%20has%20on%20facial%20assemetry.ipynb) have been published in [Balestrini, S. et al. (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244637/). This notebook explains how I investigated if mesures extracted from T1W MRI scans are associated with the facial assymetry in patients with epilepsy. For this, I build a LASSO model that can predict regional atrophy from the assymetry facial index (SAI) which is a measure of facial assymetry.
