In [Project 1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Exploratory-analysis/blob/main/Project%201%20Exploring%20if%20changes%20in%20cortical%20structures%20predict%20diagnosis%20in%20the%20ADNI%20dataset.ipynb) I explore the [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/) dataset, and investigate if cortical measures can predict the patients diagnosis.


The results of [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Exploratory-analysis/blob/main/Project%202%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20brain%20atrophy%20has%20on%20facial%20assemetry.ipynb) have been published in [Balestrini, S. et al. (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244637/). This notebook explains how I investigated if mesures extracted from T1W MRI scans are associated with the facial assymetry in patients with epilepsy. For this, I build a LASSO model that can predict regional atrophy from the assymetry facial index (SAI) which is a measure of facial assymetry.
