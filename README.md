# Predictive-modelling
The results of [Project1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%201:%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20brain%20atrophy%20has%20on%20facial%20assemetry.ipynb) have been published in [Balestrini, S. et al. (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244637/). This notebook explains how I investigated if mesures extracted from MRI scans are associated with the facial assymetry in patients with epilepsy. For this, I build a LASSO model that can predict regional atrophy from the assymetry facial index (SAI) which is a measure of facial assymetry.

In [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%202:%20Compute%20revelance%20for%20neural%20network%20that%20uses%20tabular%20data.ipynb) I first use support vector machine for predicting the type of epilepsy syndrome (SDx) from T1W MRI and DTI data, then compare the performance with other ML methods.

In [Project3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%203:%20Predict%20epilepsy%20subtype%20from%20imaging%20data.ipynb) I build a neural network using the Pytorch library and compute the layer-wise relevance propagation which helps provide information on feature importance.
