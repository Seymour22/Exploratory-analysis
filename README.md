In [Project1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%201:%20Computational%20Drug%20Discovery%20Decision%20trees%20and%20Regression%20Models.ipynb) I extend on the work by Chanin Nantasenamat that investigates the association of active molecules and bioactivity of Acetylcholinesterase using decision trees

The results of [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%202:%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20brain%20atrophy%20has%20on%20facial%20assemetry.ipynb) have been published in [Balestrini, S. et al. (2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244637/). This notebook explains how I investigated if mesures extracted from T1W MRI scans are associated with the facial assymetry in patients with epilepsy. For this, I build a LASSO model that can predict regional atrophy from the assymetry facial index (SAI) which is a measure of facial assymetry.

In [Project3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%203:%20Nai%CC%88ve%20Bayes%20for%20spam%20detection.ipynb) I develop a Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to detect spam in emails
