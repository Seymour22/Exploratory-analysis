# Predictive-modelling
In [Project1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%201:%20Investigating%20the%20impact%20brain%20atrophy%20has%20on%20facial%20assemetry.ipynb) we investigate features derived from MRI scans that are associated with the facial assymetry in patients with epilepsy. Here we build an LASSO model that can predict features representing regional atrophy that have an impact on the assymetry facial index which is a measure of facial assymetry.

In [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%202:%20Predict%20epilepsy%20subtype%20from%20imaging%20data.ipynb) we first use support vector machine for predicting the type of epilepsy syndrome (SDx) from T1W MRI and DTI data, then compare the performance with other ML methods

In [Project3](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%203:%20Predict%20epilepsy%20subtype%20from%20imaging%20data.ipynb) we build a neural network using the Pytorch library and compute the layer-wise relevance propagation which helps provide information on feature importance.
