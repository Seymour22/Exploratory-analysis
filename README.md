# Predictive-modelling
In [Project1](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/edit/main/Predict%20epilepsy%20subtype%20from%20imaging%20data.ipynb) we first use support vector machine for predicting the type of epilepsy syndrome (SDx) from T1W MRI and DTI data, then compare the performance with other ML methods


In [Project2](https://github.com/Seymour22/Predictive-modelling/blob/main/Project%202:%20Compute%20revelance%20for%20neural%20network%20that%20uses%20tabular%20data.ipynb) we build a neural network using the Pytorch library and compute the layer-wise relevance propagation which helps provide information on feature importance.
